# V1.0.1a
- Ship mass correct during launch.
- More hudtexts built in to inform the user.
- Delta-V Calculation fixed. It caused a crash when some required value returned a false value.
- Fixed background update while waiting for launch to rendezvous.
- Fixed tower cpu to allow for latest update of SLE to work.

# V1.0.1
- New Ships will from now on *automatically update* (if a connection to the KSC is available) on loading when you download and install a new version of my interface!
    - This means you won't have to delete all the active ships (and create new ships at the VAB) anymore.
    - Start-Up will take a few seconds longer.
    - Old ships of V1.0.0 or before can still be updated if they have a radio connection and the following commands are issued from the kOS CPU:
        - switch to 0.
        - run starship.
- Auto-Docking has received some small fixes.
- 'Cargo Mass' is now correct when docked. Ship Mass and Delta-V have been blocked.

# V1.0.0
- First Release!!
