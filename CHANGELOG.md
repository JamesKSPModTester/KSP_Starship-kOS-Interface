# V1.0.1
- New Ships will from now on *automatically update* on loading when you download and install a new version of my interface!
    - This means you won't have to delete all the active ships (and create new ships at the VAB) anymore.
    - Old ships of V1.0.0 or before can still be updated if they have a radio connection and the following commands are issued from the kOS CPU:
        - switch to 0.
        - run starship.
- Auto-Docking has received some small fixes.
- 'Cargo Mass' and 'Ship Mass' are now correct when docked.

# V1.0.0
- First Release!!
