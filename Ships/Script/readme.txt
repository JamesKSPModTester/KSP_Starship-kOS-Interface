-------------------Ideas--------------------
- Tooltips for main screen info text?
- Check for circ at ap when ship is escaping.
- Use Scrollbox or page enlargement for added functions?
        - Maneuver Page:
                - Suicide Burn?
                -
        - Cargo Page:
                - Operate winch to load/unload cargo/crew?

- Additional Settings?:
        - Target Orbit Inclination?
