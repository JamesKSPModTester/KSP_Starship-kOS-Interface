![Alt text](/Infographic.jpg)

# TO INSTALL:
- Download the zip file.
- Extract the contents to a folder.
- Copy the contents of this folder into your /Kerbal Space Program folder.


# IMPORTANT:
- Works only with the provided .craft files ("Starship Cargo", "Starship Crew", "Starship Tanker").

# REQUIRES:
- Starship Expansion Project and its dependencies
- Trajectories
- kOS
- TundraExplorations "TundraExploration.dll" (absolutely required for Booster Landing)
- Starship Launch Expansion

# OPTIONAL:
- Community Resource Pack (for using "liquid methane" instead of ksp's standard "liquid fuel").

# DOES NOT WORK WITH:
- RSS/RO
- FMRS
- Cryotanks



# Tips & Tricks:
To Load Cargo in the Cargo Ship:
- Drag the whole ship down to access the cargo-bay (root: Ships tank section).
- Connect your payload.
- Drage the whole ship up so far that the Tower is completely above ground (or the OLM will explode on booster return).


# Notes:
- Automatic re-stacking/refueling is currently impossible because the SEP & SLE mods lack the ability to dock together.
- When using multiple ships of the same name, they might get renamed by my scripts to avoid Interface crashes.
- Seldom Interface crashes may occur (it makes a little crashing noise). Toggling power on the kOS segment of the Ships Tank Section will restart the Interface.
- If the Interface crashes in a repeatable way, maybe make a screenshot of the cpu (righthand kOS window in game, the cpu will show some error message), and report it as a bug so I can work on it.
- Existing Ships after v1.01 will automatically update the Interface after installing the latest version from here.

This has been a pet project of mine since 2021, and I had a lot of fun making this Interface. I hope you do too!
